# Chrome Web Store Permission Justifications

## tabs justification

The extension requires the "tabs" permission to manage the Slack browser tab where scraping and messaging operations occur. The extension acts as a productivity tool that facilitates the authenticated user's own work within their Slack account, following Slack's terms of service and policies. Specifically, it uses chrome.tabs API to: query and get the active Slack tab (where the user is already logged in) to identify where to inject content scripts; update tab URLs to navigate to specific Slack channels or user profiles that the user has access to; send messages between the background service worker and content scripts running in Slack tabs; monitor tab state changes (onUpdated listener) to detect when pages finish loading before executing scraping or messaging operations; reload tabs when needed during the scraping process; verify tab existence when resuming interrupted operations after extension restart. All operations are performed through the user's authenticated Slack session, acting on behalf of the user to automate repetitive tasks they would otherwise perform manually. This permission is essential for the core functionality of helping users efficiently scrape Slack channel members and send personalized messages as part of their own outreach work.

## scripting justification

The extension requires the "scripting" permission to inject content scripts into Slack web pages using chrome.scripting.executeScript. This is necessary because: the extension needs to interact with Slack's DOM to extract member information (names, titles, profile images, user IDs) from channel member lists that the authenticated user has access to; content scripts must be injected to locate and click UI elements (buttons, message input fields) when sending personalized messages through the user's own Slack account; the extension dynamically injects scraping logic that navigates through paginated member lists, scrolls to load more members, and extracts profile data that the user would manually view; message sending functionality requires injecting scripts that can interact with Slack's message composition interface, fill in recipient information, and send messages as the authenticated user. All DOM interactions occur within the context of the Slack page through the user's authenticated session, acting as a productivity tool to automate tasks the user would perform manually. The extension operates in compliance with Slack's terms of service, facilitating the user's own work rather than creating automated bots. Without this permission, the extension cannot help users efficiently interact with Slack's web interface.

## downloads justification

The extension requires the "downloads" permission to allow users to export scraped member data as files. Specifically: after scraping channel members (data the authenticated user has access to through their Slack account), users can download the collected data (names, titles, profile images, user IDs, Slack URLs) as CSV or Excel files; the extension uses chrome.downloads.download() to save exported files with user-friendly filenames (including date stamps); users can choose the download location through Chrome's standard "Save As" dialog; this enables users to use the scraped data outside of the extension, integrate it with other tools, or perform bulk operations as part of their own outreach work. The downloads permission is essential for the data export feature, which allows users to save and reuse member information they've collected through their authenticated Slack session. This functionality helps users manage their own outreach data and is used in compliance with Slack's terms of service.

## storage justification

The extension requires the "storage" permission to persist state and data across browser sessions and extension restarts. Specifically, it uses chrome.storage.local to: save scraping state (current progress, scraped members list, scraping status) so users can close the popup and resume later; persist message sending state (current index, results, statistics) allowing the background service worker to continue sending messages through the user's authenticated Slack account even after the popup is closed; store uploaded CSV/Excel data and message templates for the messaging feature; maintain application state (isScraping, isSending flags) to prevent duplicate operations and enable proper cleanup; save user preferences and configuration that persists between extension uses; enable state recovery after extension restarts or browser crashes, allowing users to resume interrupted operations. This permission is critical for providing a reliable user experience where long-running operations (scraping hundreds of members or sending many messages) can continue in the background and survive browser restarts. All stored data is local to the user's device and relates to their own work performed through their authenticated Slack session, acting as a productivity tool to facilitate their outreach tasks.

## Host permission justification

The extension requires host permission for "https://app.slack.com/*" because: all core functionality (scraping channel members and sending messages) operates exclusively within Slack's web application through the authenticated user's own account; the extension must access Slack's web interface to extract member information from channel member lists that the user has access to; message sending functionality requires interacting with Slack's message composition and sending interface as the authenticated user; content scripts must be injected into Slack pages to read DOM elements, extract user data, and interact with UI components through the user's authenticated session; the extension navigates to specific Slack URLs (channels, user profiles) programmatically to perform automated operations on behalf of the user. The extension acts as a productivity tool that facilitates the user's own work, operating in compliance with Slack's terms of service and policies. It does not create automated bots or bypass Slack's systems, but rather helps users automate repetitive tasks they would perform manually. This is the only host permission requested, and it is strictly limited to Slack's domain where all extension functionality occurs. The extension does not access any other websites or domains.

## Remote code justification

No, I am not using Remote code.

All JavaScript code is bundled and included directly in the extension package. The extension does not:
- Load any external JavaScript files from remote URLs
- Use eval() or similar functions to execute dynamically loaded code
- Reference external modules or scripts via HTTP/HTTPS
- Download or execute code from remote servers at runtime

All dependencies (including xlsx.min.js for Excel file generation) are included as local files in the extension package. All TypeScript source files are compiled to JavaScript and bundled into the extension during the build process. The extension operates entirely with self-contained, locally packaged code.
